# Ahi

## About

Ahi is a work-in-progress HTML5 canvas game engine. It features an [Entity component system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) (ECS) which is somewhat influenced by the ECS found in [Unity](https://unity3d.com/).

Fair warning: Many features do not exist or are completely broken. :)

## Using Ahi

I find that example code is the best way to learn, so your first stop should be the [Ahi Examples repository](https://github.com/geoffb/ahi-examples).

More to come shortly.
